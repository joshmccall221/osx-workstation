OSX Workstation
======

bash script that turns a vanilla macbook pro into a complete python/node/ruby developer machine

Requirements
------------

    1) Install Xcode from the app store
    2) Pull down this script locally
    3) bash installer


What it sets up
---------------

* Homebrew for managing operating system libraries
* Python + pip + virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper
* RVM for managing versions of the Ruby programming language
* NodeJS and NVM for writing javascript build tools
* MySQL for storing relational data
* Postgres for storing relational data
* PhantomJS for running javascripts headless
* Ack for finding things in files
* The Silver Searcher for finding things fast in vim
* Tmux for saving project state and switching between projects
* Vim 7.4 and jedi installed globally for improved python auto complete
* Exuberant Ctags for indexing files for vim tab completion
* Virtualbox and Vagrant
* Memcached
* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Alfred
* iTerm2

It usually takes around 30 minutes to install (depending on your hardware)

Optional -if you find pip install breaks with a strange error code

    1) verify 'python --version' shows 2.7.5 on the command line
    2) verify python was installed with brew 'ls /usr/local/Cellar | grep python'
    3) symlink globally to fix the issue apple introduced with Xcode 5.1
    
    sudo ln -sf /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7???/bin/python /usr/bin/python
